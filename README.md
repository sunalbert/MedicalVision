# What is MedicalVision?
A pytorch-based deep learning toolkit for medical image analysis. MedicalVision aims to provide a light wrap upon pytorch, which can further reduce the time on developing new algorithms for medical image analysis task, such as classification, registration and segmentation etc.

# Motivation & Goals 
As the deep learning goes popular in computer vision, many deep learning based works/architectures have been proposed to handle traditional medical image analysis tasks (classification, registration and segmentation). Unfortunately, to the best my knowledge, there is not a simple yet effective toolkit based on pytorch which can enable fast prototyping. In the daily work, I suffer from writing DataLoaders for various medical image datasets and reproducing the algorithms introduced in some paper. To make life easy, the MedicalVision toolkit is created which aims to provide:
- Dataloaders for famous medical image dataset
- Common losses and metrics used in the state-of-the-art models
- Model zoo, including pretrained state-of-the-art models
- ...

The MedicalVision toolkit is still under development. The following popular deep learning models are coming soon:
- 2D U-net
- 3D U-net
